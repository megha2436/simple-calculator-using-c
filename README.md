# Simple Calculator Program in C

## Overview
This is a simple calculator program implemented in C that performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It serves as a beginner-friendly project to demonstrate fundamental programming concepts such as input/output, control structures, and functions.

## Features
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- Simple user interface

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- Basic knowledge of C programming

### Installation
1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

### Compilation
To compile the program, run the following command:

```bash
gcc calculator.c -o calculator
```

### Running the Program
After compilation, you can run the program with the command:

```bash
./calculator
```

## Usage
Once the program is running, follow the prompts:
1. Choose an operation (1: Addition, 2: Subtraction, 3: Multiplication, 4: Division).
2. Enter the two numbers you wish to operate on.
3. The program will display the result of the operation.

## Example
```
Choose an operation:
1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division
Enter your choice: 1
Enter first number: 
Enter second number: 
Result: 
```

## Code Structure
- **calculator.c**: The main source file containing the implementation of the calculator logic.
- **functions.h**: (Optional) A header file for function prototypes, if you choose to separate the logic into different files.
